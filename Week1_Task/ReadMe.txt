>> This Python program is an interactive Star Pattern Generator that prints:

1. Lower Triangular
2. Upper Triangular
3. Pyramid patterns

>> Key Python Concepts Used:

1. Functions: Each pattern is modular and reusable.
2. Loops: for loops generate pattern shapes.
3. Conditionals: Menu-driven choice using if-elif-else.
4. User Input: Rows and pattern choice taken from user.
5. __name__ == "__main__": Ensures controlled execution.
6. Animation: time.sleep() + flush=True creates a live drawing effect for each star.

It gives the user control over the experience and makes the output dynamic and engaging.!
