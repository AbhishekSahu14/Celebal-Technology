In this task, I built a Singly Linked List using Pythonâ€™s Object-Oriented Programming principles. The implementation includes:

-> A Node class to store data and the next reference.

-> A LinkedList class with methods to:

       > Add a node to the end

       > Print the list

       > Delete the Nth node (1-based index)

-> To make it user-friendly and interactive, I added a menu-driven interface using control statements (if-else) allowing users to perform operations without editing code.

Highlights:

-> Used encapsulation and abstraction through well-structured classes and methods.

-> Handled edge cases with exception handling.

-> Designed for simplicity and extendibility.
